Hi there, I'm Julia! I currently work as a Data Scientist in the banking industry. 

My journey into the world of Data Science began during my college years, and it was during this time that I became a member of [Turing USP](https://github.com/turing-usp). This is a student-led group at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, dedicated to the realm of Artificial Intelligence. When I initially joined the group, I had little to no knowledge about AI, but we had a system that knowing the subjects first hand or not really didn't matter. The goal was to pick a topic that you found interesting, study it, and then share with the rest of the group. That way of learning really helped me, and to this day I believe that is the best way to learn something new.

With that in mind, my idea with this blog is to make it as a way for me to better study topics I'm interested in, share notes on courses I'm taking, and also use it in general as a way to better structure thoughts and experiments I'm currently working on.
